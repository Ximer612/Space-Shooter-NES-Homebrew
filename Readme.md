# NES SPACE SHOOTER HOMEBREW
This is an attempt to make a spaceshooter homebrew game for NES. You can move your spaceship multi directional and it can shoot rockets.

To run it you must download a NES emulator, I used FCEUX.

To build this game you need to install [necroassembler](https://github.com/rdeioris/necroassembler) for python and run "necro_6502.exe .\SpaceShooter.S SpaceShooter.NES"
